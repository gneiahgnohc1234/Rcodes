Title : GHG emission intensity forecasting for Malaysia
Dataset collected by the following sources:
1. Malaysia Energy Information Hub (MEIH)
   - Primary Energy Supply by Energy Sources in Malaysia from 1978 to 2020 (https://meih.st.gov.my/statistics) 
   - Final Energy Demand by Sectors in Malaysia from 1978 to 2020 (https://meih.st.gov.my/statistics) 
3. Malaysia Informative Data Centre (MYsDIC)
   - Population in Malaysia from 1970 to 2023 (https://mysidc.statistics.gov.my/indikator/downloadfile.php?ddd=xls|13366) 
5. Malaysia’s Ministry of Economy
   - Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by Sectors in Malaysia from 1987 to 2023 (https://www.ekonomi.gov.my/en/socio-economic-statistics/socio-economic/national-accounts)  
7. Our World in Data
   - GHG Emissions by Sectors in Malaysia from 1990 to 2020 (https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector) 
Objective
1. To identify the GHG emission intensity trend from 1991 to 2020 in Malaysia;
2. To determine the corelations of GHG emission with factors such as energy generation sources, GDP, population and energy demand;
3. To forecast the GHG emission intensity in Malaysia;
4. To evaluate the feasibility of achieving a 45% reduction in GHG emission intensity against GDP by 2030 compared to the 2005 baseline.  
Scope: Adopted OSEMN framework to develop a GHG emission intensity forecasting model for Malaysia, forcasting based on historical data based on the year of 1991 to 2021.  
Obtain: Understanding business goal to acquire the relevant dataset aligned with the project objectives for obtaining valuable insights for decision-making. 
Scrub: Data cleaning to address outlier records and noisy data, as well as ensure that missing data is appropriately handled. This is to enhance the quality and reliability of the dataset for subsequent analysis. 
Explore: Data preparation, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and underlying patterns within the dataset. The insights gained from EDA helps to justify the selection of appropriate models and algorithms for predicting GHG emission intensity in Malaysia based on historical data.
Modeling: The forecasting model serves as a proactive tool to assist policymakers and stakeholders in navigating the challenges for reducing emissions intensity against GDP by 45% by 2030, as outlined in Malaysia’s NETR.
